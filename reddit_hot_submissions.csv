TIFU by convincing my friend to put a marble up his ass [NSFW],1600158313.0,"Okay, granted this actually happened around 23 years ago, I just remembered it this morning. 

When I was around five I made this new friend, let's call him Tim, who had the coolest stuff. I would go to his house to play and we were becoming pretty good friends. His house was awesome, his dad had a sweet computer with games that we could use, and he just happened to have this HUGE glass container filled with some really dope marbles. 

So one day we bust out the marbles and start rolling them into each other, as you do, and everything is going normally. Just two normal kids playing with marbles. We were playing with a whole set of different colours, patterns and sizes. There were gigantic ones and tiny little ones. Unfortunately the marbles began to induce a kind of childlike creativity they didn't deserve. 

To us, being five year olds in the late 90s, asses and toilet humour were some of the funniest things you could conceive. Somehow a connection was made between those smooth-ass marbles and our smooth-ass asses. A simple connection but one that would come with repercussions. 

An idea was conceptulised and there was no turning around. We thought it would be hilarious to put a marble right up inside one of our tiny little asses. 

Thankfully it wasn't mine... 

After much of a struggle Tim managed to squeeze a small marble into himself and upon realising it wouldn't come back out, began bawling his eyes out, having to be driven to the hospital by his mum to have the said marble removed from his anus. 

Needless to say, I got in a LOT of shit. I was banned from ever going around to Tim's house again and I don't remember ever seeing him again to be honest.

Neighbour complaining about noise,1600160387.0,"Our rental contract, as is normal here, stipulates a ""quiet period"" between 10pm and 7am every night, where we're not supposed to be loud.

We moved in on a Saturday and were of course unpacking on Sunday. So our new neighbour below us knocked on our door and screamed at us, and told us to read the part of our contract about the ""quiet period."" So I did, and Sundays aren't mentioned. 10pm to 7am every day of the week. So we carried on.

He has called the police on us several times for just doing normal things such as rearranging furniture. Each time, he would lie to the police that he had come to speak to us about it first, which he had not. The reasons included things like ""dropping things too often"" to ""using the stairs at night."" These reasons are of course ridiculous, but each time I have just shown them the contract which all residents sign. If he has signed the contract, he consents to me making noise during these periods.

We complained to the letting agency that he was harassing us for simply making the normal amount of noise people make from living in an apartment. However, nothing changed.

I checked with our other neighbours to see if they had any complaints about our noise level, and they all said no.

After he called the police several times, I decided to begin malicious compliance. I went down to the neighbour with a copy of the house rules, which we have all signed, and told him to please read them, specifically, the exact times which are the ""quiet period."" Then for the next week or so, any hammering, drilling or other loud things I had to do, I saved for 9:50pm. Even if I didn't have anything I needed to do, I made sure to make noise right up until 10pm. After I did this for about a week, we stopped hearing from him, and haven't had any noise complaints since, and it's been several months now.

Now, a couple of heavy metal fans have moved into the apartment next to him and I couldn't be happier.",163,5063,0.97,S,False,Malicious Compliance,pleasureboat,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/it54gl/neighbour_complaining_about_noise/
"If your child's allergies are so bad that his classmates can't eat what he's allergic to, he shouldn't be going to a public school.",1600160632.0,"When I grew up, we could bring anything to school. I would eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches a lot, or bring nut based products to school. I did this for my entire school life. If a kid had an allergy, they dealt with it, or they didn't go to my school.

Fast forward to me being a dad and sending my kid to school, camp, daycare, etc.

No products with nuts are allowed because some kid might have an allergy. WTF? This became a thing that we were inconveniencing the majority because someone *might* have an allergy. And with nuts, the allergy levels are from nothing to almost death. If a nut is going to kill you, you definitely shouldn't be out in public because eventually, you are going to get hit with some nuts.

Then there are certain years where someone might have a specific allergy and the class teacher will send a letter home saying the kids aren't to have any of THAT product in the food they bring to school.

Some letters home over the years had: shrimp, peaches, and fish. I am sure there were a couple more, but I can't remember them. I'm not saying I would send my kid to school with shrimp or fish, but peaches? When they are in season, why wouldn't I? Or maybe she might have a fruit salad thing...nope, can't do it, the teacher will confiscate it, and call me on it, and I look like the dick.

I get accessibility and all that, but your allergies shouldn't be my problem, and do you know how hard it is to pack up a lunch for your kid (or for yourself even) when your whole life is based on foods that someone *might* be allergic to?

I remember spending HOURS of my time finding snacks for my kid to take to school that had absolutely no nuts, but was still healthy. I'm sorry, I'm not sending her with fruit rollups and other sugary shit. Nuts are actually a really healthy snack, and really kid friendly.

Finally, are you parents with kids with allergies going to pay for all the parents of the kids that have to buy alternative foods to what they normally would send their kid to school with? I doubt it, so why make YOUR problem into OUR problem?

I have started reading to my wife and it is an awesome feeling,1600172244.0,"Hi everyone,

Sometime last month I saw a post from this subreddit on the popular screen talking about how they only watched the Lord of the Rings movies and how the books vastly expanded the story. So I thought, why not, I love fantasy books and decided I would start from the beginning of the series when I could. Jump to last week, my wife and I head to B&N and pick up a few books. I headed straight to the sci-fi and fantasy section as usual and found the LOTR section. I picked up a copy of the Silmarillion among a few other books and headed out (obviously stopping by the board game selection before leaving).

Jump to 3 nights ago, I was sitting in bed reading and my wife was saying she was having a really tough time going to sleep and I said I could read to her. As a note, my wife doesn't prefer the time dedicated to world building that I enjoy, which is basically all of the Silmarillion for as far as I've gotten. So I started reading to her and about a chapter later she was out like a light.

So for the last couple of nights, our night time procedure has been to get ready for bed then for her to tell me to grab the book and start reading and I've got to say... It is an awesome feeling.  I plan to only read it before bed so I can make this last as long as possible.",131,2234,0.95,,False,"So many books, so little time",WearyAsymptote,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/it7lh8/i_have_started_reading_to_my_wife_and_it_is_an/

A story of a cancer ridden NSF. Journey from PES A to PES F.,1600172135.0,"Hi all,

I've been told by many to share my highly peculiar and unusual story, so here I am doing so.

I returned to Singapore from studying overseas in September 2019 a month before my enlistment. I met up with old friends, picked up a temp job as a packer to pass time and earn a little bit of extra cash before entering my new journey in NS.

October 8th 2019: Today, I enlist in the Singapore Police Force at the Home Team Academy. My parents flew to Singapore to witness my right of passage from an ""Ah Boy"" to a ""Man"". A few days before entering camp I developed possibly one of the worst coughs I've ever had and thought to myself;

""You can't go to the MO on your first week you'll look like a chao keng warrior""

Despite the bad cough, I was genuinely enjoying my time in the Police Officer Basic Course (SPF's BMT). I made good friends whom I hung out with on the week-ends and volunteered for positions in camp. Physically, I was doing the best I could as I wanted to reach my goal of an IPPT score of 95. My first IPPT I was handed a score of 84 with which I was content but wanted to improve on.

As weeks went by, I decided it was now ok to go to the MO and get treated for my cough. I was given some basic medications to treat coughs. Thankfully, those medications did help to bring the symptoms down and I was feeling a hell of a lot better. That was around the time I took my 2nd IPPT and improved to 91. I mention these IPPT scores not to show off but to show you how unexpected a sickness may arrive, even when you think you are in the pink of health.

Mid-November: I notice a lump in my neck!

While having swimming lessons at HTA, which by the way, honestly is a beautiful camp, I felt slight discomfort while doing different types of strokes. I felt my neck and realised there was a large lump. I didn't think much of it, and assumed it was my lymph nodes swelling up because of my cough. A few days after that discovery, the antibiotics and cough syrup I received started to wear off and my cough came back in full force. I went to the MO once again, but this time mentioned my inflated Lymph Nodes. I was given another round of antibiotics and was told; if the lymph nodes don't swell down come back.

A Christmas surprise: My lymph nodes never decreased in size.

We were lucky enough to receive a few days Block leave to celebrate Christmas and the New Year's. I quickly flew back to KL to see my friends and family. Despite having an amazing time there, the fact that my lymph nodes kept increasing in size was keeping me from fully enjoying myself. My flight back to SG was on a Sunday morning and I had to report back to camp by Sunday evening. As soon as I landed, I went to the nearest clinic right before closing time. The doctor took down my symptoms and told me he suspected there was a slight chance this might be Tuberculosis which itself carries a 6 month treatment plan. He gave me a few days MC and referred me to Polyclinic to get an x-ray. By the way, big-ups to the Singapore Public health care system; it's truly out of this world. Anyways, the x-ray came back inconclusive so, I was sent to Changi General Hospital for an MRI on the 31st of December and this is where things took a turn towards the dark. The doctor came back with the results and mentioned it might be tuberculosis, or it might be a cancer of the lymph nodes. My face went pale, and immediately felt the need to cry. We were not sure of it yet, so I told myself; I'm 18, fit and healthy. There is no way in hell I have cancer. To confirm doctor's suspicions, I was sent to SGH where I met, in my opinion the world's best oncologist. There, they suggested I did a biopsy (small procedure on my neck to remove a lymph node) and a PET-Scan (heavily prevalent scan to detect cancer growth over time).

January 10th brought my life's most devastating news yet: I was alone. I went to see my Oncologist to get my results. My parents had important things to attend to overseas and were instead with me on the phone during the meeting. My doctor asked my parents to fly down and I assumed the worst. She wanted my parents to be here with my while she announces the news but I couldn't handle the wait and asked her bluntly; did I have cancer, yes or no. She nodded sympathetically, and my whole life flashed before eyes. I felt like breaking down. I cannot find words intense enough to describe the absolutely horrid feeling of someone informing you that you are cancer ridden, let alone at the young age of 18. When my parents arrived, I was given the full diagnosis. Stage 4A Nodular Sclerosis Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The cancer had spread to to my neck, my lungs, my spine and the bone on my ass. I thought I must've had a small beginner cancer at first since I didn't feel any worse than unusual except for incessant itching and night sweats, but nope, I was given the creme de la creme of bad diagnoses.

The following days went by quickly, I accepted my situation and was ready to tackle cancer. Before I knew it, I found myself in a hospital bed receiving chemotherapy. The most unexpected, emotionally and physically painful experience I've endured. There were multiple complications which landed me around 1.5 months in hospital, sleepless nights, losing sight of what feeling normal felt like and just feeling content with not being in excruciating pain. And the stress with COVID as well! Either way, I went through my 12 rounds of chemotherapy as best as I could with the amazing support of my parents taking care of me, solely moving back to Singapore to be with me. I tried to live my life as normal as I could and realised that was foolish and to instead, take things at my new pace of life.

It is now September, 9 months post my diagnosis and 2.5 months post my last chemotherapy. You truly don't appreciate life until it might be taken away from you. As cheesy as it sounds, it's true. I was given a second chance at life and never take a day for granted. Each day brings it's own beautiful wonders and sometimes hardships. Just be thankful we are all alive and love the people around you as they are the ones who come forward in your time of need. Many lessons were learnt during my treatment and although I am not grateful for having had cancer, I appreciate much more who I am now than who I was before cancer.

Thank you to the amazing doctors and nurses at SGH and everyone at SPF who was involved with my case and the MO at HTA. The Singaporean community really is the most giving and caring although it might not always seem like it.

If you made it all the way down here, thank you for reading. Writing this brought back the first tears since the end of chemotherapy :')

Love,

Jules.

"YSK that children should NEVER be forced to give hugs, kisses, or any other affection to anyone - including family members",1600140248.0,"Teaching kids about bodily autonomy from an early age is crucial, and giving them the tools to politely (but firmly) say ""No"" when they feel uncomfortable  performing affectionate acts is a great first step. 

Critically, this must include parents and other family members,  even if those people get their feelings hurt. The child's bodily autonomy and setting them up for their future as adults is more important than Great-Aunt Gertrude getting a halfhearted hug.


THIS ALSO APPLIES TO TICKLING. If a kid breathlessly asks you to stop tickling them, *even if they appear to be enjoying themselves and laughing*, it's important that you stop for them to catch their breath and do a quick check-in to see of they want to continue. 

 Almost every time I've done this with my own son, he will ask for more tickles after catching his breath.

 It's about letting them know that their body belongs to THEM. 

**WHY YSK:**

Because everyone has the right to decide whether they want to be touched,  and that includes children,  from as early as possible. 

There are countless examples of all the dark things that kids suffer through every day which I don't need to get into, we all know what they are. 

To be clear, it is NEVER the child's fault if they are  victimized,  nor is this advice meant to be some kind of protection against evil. 

I'm a mother to a toddler, and my husband and I are in full agreement on this, practicing what we preach.  If kiddo doesn't want to get all cuddled up on, he knows he can always refuse and we will listen.",983,26413,0.84,Other,False,You Should Know,griftylifts,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/it0pxr/ysk_that_children_should_never_be_forced_to_give/

"When I was a kid, my dad kept a second family in our basement.",1600173905.0,"Growing up, I thought everyone had a second family in their basement. In retrospect, I understand how ridiculous that sounds… but it was all I’d ever known.

I knew that every night, my dad tented the leftovers from dinner with foil, got up without a word, and carried the plate to the basement. I’d listen from my room as he lumbered down the creaking steps, held my breath to hear the muffled mumblings of his greeting.

I knew that every morning, he’d make the trip downstairs to see his second family off before work, then kiss me on the top of my head and ruffle my hair as he walked out.

I knew that each Christmas, he’d bring a sack of brightly wrapped packages downstairs in a Santa suit.

I knew that my dad had a second family in the basement, and it seemed so normal that I thought *everyone* else did too.

I’ll never forget the first time I asked my mom about them. I was young – maybe five – when I finally found the words to ask: “Mommy, why can’t I play with the people in the basement?”

My mom was the human embodiment of frenetic energy, an organic perpetual motion machine. Always pacing, or cleaning, or stirring a pot. Always with a lit cigarette tucked between her yellowing fingers.

I’ll never forget that, as that question hung in the air, she finally *stopped* for the first time. Her stillness was unsettling in a way I can’t quite explain.

“We don’t talk about them,” she rushed, chasing the hurried statement with a lengthy drag off her cigarette. She blew a plume of smoke out the opened window before leaning down to meet me at face level, her bloodshot eyes mere inches from my own. “You don’t need to play with the kids, but the kids need Daddy.”

She paused again, the haunting image of her at a standstill etching itself into my mind permanently. Finally, she muttered, “Daddy needs them too.”

That night, I heard my mom shrieking at my dad in their bedroom. I was surprised that they didn’t know that I knew, more shocked – frightened, even – to find that they didn’t *want* me to know. Most of all, they didn’t want me to tell anyone at school – anyone at all, really.

After that night, everything was different. My dad only tented the leftovers after dinner, only brought the food downstairs after I’d gone to bed. He stopped visiting them in the mornings altogether. My mom started acting differently, too. I’d always noticed that she was… distant from my dad; had always noticed how she bristled under his touch, how she stole away to the other side of the room whenever he entered. But it got worse after that… as a kid, I felt deeply guilty. I felt like I’d ruined my parents’ marriage.

But I was just a kid, and I was curious. My mom meant to dissuade me from asking more questions, but she accidentally gave away something that made me even *more* curious – the downstairs family had kids, maybe kids my own age to play with.

I wanted – *needed* to know about them, in the way that little kids *need* to understand all of the strangeness of this chaotic world, *need* to make sense of the nonsense that surrounds us daily. The nonsense that we become acclimated to as adults but struggle with endlessly as children, like a puzzle or a riddle or a word problem on a math test about buying eighty watermelons.

Another change following that critical night: the basement door was fitted with sturdy lock. Even still, I needed to know… there’s something horribly dreadful about finding out that a second basement family is abnormal, something more horrible still about not knowing who or *why.* By the time I was seven, I made up my mind to get to the bottom of it.

To avoid getting in trouble, I could only investigate when three conditions were met: I was home from school, my dad was still at work, and my mom wasn’t around to catch me. These circumstances rarely overlapped, but the first time I came home from school to find that my dad’s car wasn’t in the garage and my mom’s endless movement had driven her to the point of exhaustion, I threw off my shoes and crept to the basement door, quiet in my sock feet.

And then, I knocked.

It was a quiet knock, for fear of waking my mom from her nap, but it was a knock, nonetheless. It was more than just a knock, too, it was an initiation, an invitation, a confrontation of my life’s greatest – and most terrifying – mystery.

I jumped when a gentle knock returned from the other side. It was almost immediate… like the person on the other side had been *waiting* for me. The thought froze me in place for a moment, but I knew I didn’t any have time to waste.

My mouth felt suddenly of sandpaper and chalk, but I leaned into the door to whisper, “hi.”

“Hi.”

It was a little girl, her voice sweet yet timid. Like testing the keys on a piano for the first time.

“I-I’m Ricky. What’s your name?”

A long pause.

“Lila. My brother’s is Isaac, but he doesn’t talk so good. But he’s still little. Mommy says he’ll start talking when he’s ready.”

“There’s three of you down there?”

“Mhmm,” she replied simply, as if the entire situation felt as wholly normal for her as it had for me, on the opposite side of the basement door. “Daddy comes to visit sometimes, though, so I guess there’s four.”

My eyes widened as a flurry of questions began to sprout in my mind, but I heard my mom start to stir in her room. I sped down the hallway and into the playroom. I busied my hands with my toys, but my mind was somewhere else… the sprouts of questions continued to grow rapidly, soon overtaking my thoughts like an unruly patch of weeds.

And like weeds, the questions were stubborn; hard to – *impossible* to get rid of. The roots of the situation and its implication unraveled, stretched through my whole body. Fear planted itself firmly in my belly as I was forced to confront the possibility that I didn’t really know my dad, didn’t really know my own family at all. If my dad was Lila’s dad, too, what did that mean for me? For my family?

And why wasn’t she allowed to come out of the basement?

Over the next couple years, I stole away to the basement door in those rare moments of freedom. I got to know Lila, got to like her and eventually even to love her – she was my best friend. As a kid, I was pretty lonely; my classmates shied away from me for reasons I couldn’t quite understand, like something about me was inherently repellant to my peers. I only had one friend at school.

And at home, I had Lila.

As we spoke more, a never-ending stream of back and forth questioning crammed into the briefest moments of time, we both came to understand the differences between us, between our lives and our circumstances. The differences that at first felt so *normal* grew bigger and sharper and scarier than either of us could comprehend.

The unfairness of it all became impossible to ignore.

Lila lamented that she wasn’t allowed to go to school, that she couldn’t go outside to play or make friends or ride bikes around the cul-de-sac in the summer until the streetlamps flickered on and the cicadas started to scream. She even longed for the things I loathed most– homework, rinsing off my dishes after dinner, tidying up my room each Sunday morning.

She said she’d lived in that basement all of her life, was probably even *born* down there. She couldn’t remember anything different before being locked up in the cold and musty room.

I’m ashamed to admit this, but, eventually… I couldn’t manage the guilt I felt for living the life Lila never had, *could* never have in my mind. I was so young, so naïve… I didn’t know how to manage the situation anymore, so I did the only thing I could think of.

I stopped trying.

I stopped visiting Lila. No more secret, whispered exchanges; no more quick knocks on the door just to let her know that I was there, that anyone at all was there for her. Days and weeks and months and years trickled by with Lila never quite leaving my thoughts, but with her existence instead… *compartmentalized*.

Confined to the basement of my own mind.

At home, it was harder to keep thoughts of her locked away. When my dad brought her dinner hours past my bedtime, I’d lay awake warm in my bed. Sometimes I’d hear her scream. Sometimes I’d hear the tray clatter to the floor, the plate fracturing on impact. Sometimes I’d hear her crying – awful, painful sobs – while I assembled new Lego sets in the playroom.

Sometimes she… she would call out my name. I’ll never forgive myself for this – I hate myself for it, and I *deserve* to – but I ignored her every time.

Worst of all, though, was when she started knocking.

I was finishing up my science homework for the day when the first knock came.

A quiet knock… but a knock, nonetheless. An initiation, an invitation, a *confrontation*.

My blood ran cold as I realized where it was coming from; *who* it was coming from.

I hopped on my bike and didn’t come home until dinner was on the table.

That night, I heard my dad scream back at Lila for the first time. Yelled for her to *knock it off* with all the knocking. He took care of her, of her little brother and her mom, and that he could only do that if she stayed in the basement, if she stayed quiet.

She wasn’t persuaded, though, and her knocking only grew more frequent, and *louder*. I was about ten years old by then, so I had a little more freedom… all the freedom in the world, compared to Lila. I avoided my house at all costs, only returning in the evenings, where I’d be greeted immediately by the knocking.

By then, it was less knocking and more ramming the total weight of her body into the door. My mother took to vacuuming the house obsessively just to cover up the noise. She wouldn’t even look my dad in the eye anymore. I imagined the bruises blooming on Lila’s shoulder, up and down the length of her arm. If it hurt her, she didn’t let on.

She didn’t stop.

Sleep became a distant memory, leaving me dazed and irritable and confused and – most of all – terrified. I began showing up at my schoolfriend’s – now my *only* friend’s – house unannounced just to escape Lila’s knocking.

His parents clearly didn’t like me, and tensions rose between the two of us kids, escalating to a boiling point that ended in a fight. I slugged him in the gut, and he returned with the words that broke me – broke *everything*.

A blow far more powerful than he could’ve delivered with small hands balled up into fists.

“My mom says you’re a *bastard*, that your mom’s a *whore!*”

I had to look up the words in my dictionary when I got home.

I had to gather the courage to, once again, ask a difficult question: “Mom… am I a bastard?”

I had to watch my mom lose her momentum, to *stop* again.

I had to watch what little light she had left in her go out.

I had to sit there as she left the room, had to sit there spilling hot tears as the knocking kicked up again, each powerful thrust against the door wracking my mind, a painful reminder that Lila was coming for me.

But, my mom came back, and she returned with an old newspaper clipping in her hands, worn at the edges. She held it to her chest as she finally – *finally* – told me the truth about Lila, about Dad’s second family in the basement.

I was young, but I needed to know. My mom knew it, too.

Through choking sobs, she told me about my dad’s old family, the one he’d had and *made* before he met her. The horrible mistake they’d made, the one that gave her the best thing she’d ever had in her life but took away three others. About how my dad’s old wife was already skating on thin ice, her cries for help that went unanswered, how when she found out about what my mom and my dad were doing that what little was left beneath her shattered.

About how they couldn’t have known, but about the guilt she carried regardless – “like a heavy backpack, mom?”

“Yes, sweetie. But I can never put it down.”

That Lila was dead; and Isaac, too. That their mom had done *that* to them, and then did it to herself too. My dad found them in the basement when he got home from work. That he’d never forgiven himself, and my mom never had either. That when they reappeared back in the basement like nothing had happened, even after their bodies were taken and buried all those years ago, they couldn’t think of anything to do but to give them as normal of a life as possible.

Yet another difficult question: “but… why do they have to stay in the basement?”

I found out later that evening, when my dad came home from work and unlocked the door. Lila came out of the shadows, and I flinched instinctively as I saw her face for the first time, saw the gaping hole in her face where her left eye should have been. Isaac was little like Lila said, but the oozing wound to his jaw would have made it nearly impossible for him to speak if he had the chance to grow up.

I was scared at first, but I put on my brave face and took Lila by the hand. I played with Lila and Isaac for the first time; shared my toys with them, laughed with them. I didn’t meet their mom that day, but I would, years later. Once she and Lila and Isaac knew what became of them, she struggled to cope. She doesn’t come out often, but I treat her with kindness when she does. The woman I know her as now couldn’t imagine doing what she did.

My dad’s second family still stayed inside, but they were no longer confined to the shadows of the basement after that day. They became less of my dad’s *second* family as we all became one larger family that laughed and played and loved together.

I don’t live in that house anymore… I’m an adult now, with an enormous appreciation for all of the freedom and opportunities available to me that I once took for granted. I know my family is far from normal – even horrible and horrifying in many ways that I helped to perpetuate as a kid – but it’s all I’ve ever known. I love them… all of them.

I still visit whenever I can, for birthdays and for Christmas and for summer vacations. And whenever I do visit, I take a moment to be grateful for the fact that when I knock on the front door, [Lila opens it](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/).

I have to remove my brother from life support today.,1600154449.0,"26 days ago my brother was riding his motorcycle when he was run over, pinned under the car and dragged.  

Initially we were told his brain was fine, despite the enormous damage to his body. 17 days ago his brain shut down. The hospital has ordered every brain test I’ve requested, as I’ve searched for any possible hope. The second opinion I sought from a different hospital gave a worse prognosis than the first. 

He has children, who have never gone without a hug from their father. They are consumed with every emotion.

My heart is breaking. I feel like a third of it dying.  The rest of it is just pouring out as I realize the unimaginable grief my father is dealing with. It’s almost like watching the story of Job unfold in front of my very eyes.

His wife of 52 years has Alzheimer’s. He has Parkinson’s which leaves his genius and deeply caring mind very much intact, but without confidence, because of his minimal ability to communicate. He’s lost both his brothers within two weeks, along with a cousin, and then he is told his oldest son is dying and there is no way to save him. 

This man always reads his bible everyday. His prayers are probably on constant repeated loops. He raised 3 independent thinking children, each with such a strong faith. 

Then I remember, that a single drop in an ocean causes a ripple that reaches all its shores. Im reminded with over 100 billion galaxy’s, the earth is the only planet perfectly placed from its sun; allowing it to sustain innumerable life. 

So, I will raise a hallelujah.

I will pray and search the depths of my soul trying to find forgiveness for a driver with no insurance, a suspended license: and yet, decided he was capable of eating pizza and texting while driving.",108,2925,0.97,,False,Off My Chest | A Safe Community for Support,HennaArist,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/it3zf2/i_have_to_remove_my_brother_from_life_support/

Update: my [33m] wife [25f] constantly makes a conscious effort to humiliate me during my lessons over Zoom,1600133656.0,"About a week and a half ago, I made a post here about my wife consciously trying to sabotage my lessons over Zoom. It seemed that everything she did was just to embarrass me in front of my students. If you want more information about the situation, you can find the original post here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/illtan/my_33m_wife_25f_constantly_makes_a_conscious/

My first lesson after making that post, my wife went straight back to her old antics. I was in the lesson room as students gradually joined, talking to a student who was interested in luxury cars. At some point during the conversation, I said “yeah I think I’d have to go with the Lamborghini there.” I heard from behind the door in the basement where I was teaching “LaMBorGhiNi” in the sarcastic exaggerated tone of voice that kids will use to mock you. I realized she was being childish again, but figured she’d eventually tire herself out.

A few minutes after the lesson started, I used the word “circumference” to describe a word problem. I then heard “ciRCuMFeREnCe” from behind the door at the top of the stairs, followed by giggling. Since the timing was right, as I was about to have the students take a shot at a problem, I set them to the task, muted my mic/disabled my camera, and quietly crept up the stairs. I suddenly opened the door to find my wife with a cup over her ear pushed against the door so she could hear me. 

I whisper-shouted at her for her behavior for about a minute. I asked if she was five years old and what the hell was wrong with her. She feigned fear and shock as if I had held her against the wall with my hands wrapped around her throat, which made me just sigh and go back downstairs to finish my lesson.

For the rest of the lesson she was quiet, but after it I went upstairs to bring up what she did. She started asking if I was going to yell at her again. I responded that I wouldn't, and I tried to get back on topic, but no matter what I said about her behavior, her response was the same. When I brought up her stomping in the room above before, “are you going to yell at me again?” When I brought up her sliding plastic files under the door during a lesson before, “oh, are you going to yell at me again?” When I brought up anything she has done during lessons, the answer was the same, over and over again.

There is absolutely no way to broach the topic with her now. I called her doctor and said that her behavior is erratic, and that she might have PPD. The doctor said that he could ask about it when she came in, but there is not much else he could do. The next day I tried to sit my wife down for a calm discussion about the possibility of her having PPD, to which she responded she had PTSD from my “abusive shouting.” Right. When I suggested therapy, together, she said “oh, to fix your anger management problems? Sounds good.”

I teach in my car in front of a Starbucks now. Outside of lesson time we haven't really had any issues, and now that I'm outside the house teaching, we are strained but stable. I know this is not a very satisfactory outcome, but I think she has deep underlying issues that are going to need professional intervention. When I said I would happily go to therapy with her to find a solution to our communication issues, she told me that I should go alone. I think that may actually be a good step because having a neutral party to listen to my worries and guide me towards better de-escalation tactics would be highly beneficial. I could also try to entice her to join gradually.

TL;DR: my wife has no desire to change. I’m going to start therapy alone and see if I can’t get her to join. Her doctor will bring up the possibility of PPD in her next appointment.",2568,20870,0.93,/r/all,False,Relationship Advice,ThrowRAsabotaged,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/isyxrx/update_my_33m_wife_25f_constantly_makes_a/

Raid loot needs to be more unique.,1600163052.0,"As it stands currently, there is pretty much no reason to do a Raid except for pinnacle gear, seals and to have fun (which are fair enough reasons). And maybe just to get a weapon you like. The loot isn't unique enough to justify going out to acquire it. 

Back in Destiny 1, all the Vault of Glass weapons came with Oracle Disruptor 

>  This weapon deals bonus damage to Oracles in the Vault of Glass. 

Although not useful outside of the raid itself, it was still unique

Kings fall weapons all came with Cocoon (Which is Auto Loading Holster) and dealt bonus damage to taken enemies. 

Wrath of the Machine weapons had Whirlwind's Curse

> This weapon does bonus damage against Fallen. Bonus Agility when this weapon is equipped

Now with the armour, Vault of Glass armour would have perks like Vex Striker which would have a chance to spawn an orb of light after killing a vex enemy with a precision kill.  There was also Anti Praetorian which would grant bonus super energy after killing one. Wrath of the Machine had Eliksni Immunity, which would make you take less damage from Fallen for a short time after picking up an orb. I could list the many other perks but you get the idea.

Although, Destiny 2 does have perks like this on our armour because we are able to apply it using a mod slot. But when compared to armour you can get from other sources, it's really not that much better. It's possible to get armour that is stat rolled better out in the world than raid gear. But, raid gear is more consistent in giving good rolls. What if raid gear could roll really heavily into one stat and have completely unique stat rolls? For example, you could get a helmet with maximum recovery but 0 in all the other stats. What if the gauntlets for Warlocks increased the amount of scout rifle damage you did and the gauntlets for Titans increased shotgun damage. This could also give us more class identity. 

Now what do we have in Destiny 2 on raid weapons to make them stand out? (pretty much) Nothing. The only one we have is Taken Spec which gives bonus damage against take which, in my opinion, should be a blanket perk across all Last Wish raid weapons, like how all the raid weapons in Destiny 1 had perks relating to where they were obtained and the enemies in that raid. Raid weapons should have unique perks that only they can have that is on all of them. Some raid energy weapons could do 10% extra damage against shields and some kinetics have 10% against un-shielded enemies. If there is ever Hard mode added again, the hard mode ones could have a 20% bonus. Just as an example. There should also be more perks that only raid weapons can have on them. 

Maybe give us set bonuses? This could work with weapons as well. If you have the full raid set on, or some pieces (Could go 2,4,5,6,7,8 this includes weapons) you get some sort of bonus at each tier of depending on the pieces you have on.",222,1649,0.93,Discussion,False,Destiny | Reddit,Lamipoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/it5m6q/raid_loot_needs_to_be_more_unique/

How do so many people smoke weed and do psychadelics and other drugs and still manage to hold stable jobs that can pay for their drugs as well as nice living conditions?,1600135496.0,"Only around half a million people in america are homeless, but over 30 million americans smoke weed, and thats not including psychadelics and non conventional drugs.  How do so many people manage to do drugs and still have good living conditions and functional lives when so many jobs are avidly against hiring drug users of any kind?  Its almost impossible for me no matter how hard i try to think of any realistic career choice that would pay for atleast a decent small apartment and living conditions on my own and still allow me to get high (as in not urine testing me or anything).  I really love getting high, it just honestly makes me happy, and i know you cant always have what you want in life, but i dont want to give it up but i also need to start thinking about career choices for my life and what kind of degree i want if any, so wanted to ask any members of society who do any recreational drugs how you manage it and what sorts of careers you can get away with it in and still make decent money.

Edit: most of you are answering in a way of how you actually work and be high, and sorry if i worded the question weird but basically what i was trying to say is i get high on weed/psychadelics a lot, but i need to start getting an actual job that like im gonna devote to career wise, but almost every job i see drug tests occasionally or at the start, so i wanted to know what kinds of jobs you have that pay a good living wage but dont test except for maybe in the beginning.",1382,6940,0.93,Unanswered,False,No such thing as stupid questions,Slushy61,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/iszg83/how_do_so_many_people_smoke_weed_and_do/

# How to participate:

**Watch talks:** The main body of the conference is made up of eight panels of 3-4 speakers, which have all been recorded in advance. Each speaker gets 10 minutes to discuss their own research, followed by a group discussion led by an expert moderator. Today’s panels have already been released via our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJudPwztZyg2BQjhetw_bww) – these recordings will be available indefinitely, so you’ll always be able to catch up on anything you missed.

**Ask questions:** Each panel will have its own AMA-style thread where you can ask the speakers and moderators anything you’d like to about their work. These will go live according to the schedule above, and will continue as long as the participants feel like answering more questions!

**Attend live events:** While most panels are recorded, some conference events are live. Today’s keynote address by Prof. Alex Wellerstein will take place live on Zoom – you can still [register to attend here](https://us04web.zoom.us/webinar/register/1915994359746/WN_2jAOCQiZSGSxfqeKx5O_xg), but if it’s full don’t worry – we’ll be releasing a recording as soon as possible once it’s done.

Throughout the conference, we’ll also be hosting live networking sessions for participants and audience members to attend. Anyone is welcome to sign up for whichever event they wish – the [full list can be found here](https://www.askhistorians.com/conference-networking). Today’s sessions are focused on Academia, broadly defined – they are aimed primarily at people undertaking (or interested in) academic degrees or careers in history, but anyone interested is welcome!

**Be part of the conversation:** We’ll be treating these daily conference megathreads like our Friday Free-For-Alls – you’re welcome to use them to discuss the conference, leave questions or comments or chat informally about the day’s papers, though keep in mind that our rules about civility are still very much in force.

"130 years ago (almost to the day), Louis Le Prince vanished after making the world's first film.",1600166161.0," [https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/heritage-and-retro/heritage/unsolved-mystery-yorkshires-vanished-film-pioneer-2945313](https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/heritage-and-retro/heritage/unsolved-mystery-yorkshires-vanished-film-pioneer-2945313) 

 On 16th September 1890, a 49 year- old Louis Le Prince bade farewell to his brother Albert in Dijon, France, and boarded an express train to Paris.

Le Prince may have walked with a spring in his step that day: after a short stop to see family in the French capital, he was due at a public screening in New York, where he was set to unveil the world’s first ever moving pictures to be captured on film.

 It’s an event which may well have changed the course of history - but it never took place. 

 After boarding his train that autumn morning, Le Prince was never seen again. He failed to disembark in Paris, and no luggage or personal belongings were ever recovered. Over a century later, his disappearance remains shrouded in mystery. 

One of the rumours advanced by Le Prince’s wife, Elizabeth Le Prince, in the years following his disappearance was that rival Thomas Edison had something to do with Le Prince’s vanishing.

The theory goes that Thomas Edison was keen to eliminate competition in the race to be crowned the inventor of moving pictures, and thus ordered a hitman to kill Le Prince before he had a chance to screen his moving pictures in New York.

Adding to suspicions of foul play was the fact that Le Prince’s son, Adolphe, was shot in 1901 while hunting. Whether his death was a murder or suicide is still unknown.

After his father’s disappearance, Adolphe had become involved in trying to establish his legacy as the inventor of film, serving as a witness in an 1891 court case where Thomas Edison was attempting to win the title.

In 2003, a researcher looking in the Paris police archives discovered a post-mortem photograph which bore a resemblance to Le Prince, which some have taken as proof of the inventor’s murder.

David Wilkinson, however, dismisses the theory as “ludicrous”. In his 2015 film, he examines the photograph matching the description of Le Prince and points out an inconsistency in the length of the facial hair in the photograph.

David also puts the case to an ex police officer, who says there is nothing “factual or evidential” to suggest that Edison put a hit out on Le Prince.

The theory that Le Prince was a victim of fratricide by his own brother, Albert, rests on the fact that Albert was the last person who claimed to have seen Le Prince before he boarded his train to Paris.

It’s known that Albert was the architect and executor of their mother’s estate upon her death in 1887, and that Louis was owed money as part of her will.

Some theorise that Albert killed Louis in a row over the will, and that Albert’s claim to have waved his brother off at the station may in fact have been false.

Laurie Snyder, a living descendent of the Le Princes, contests this theory, saying that the relationship between the two brothers was known to have been warm and loving, as evidenced by surviving letters between the pair.

What’s more, in David Wilkinson’s 2015 film, Ms Snyder points out that Albert was himself a man of means, and would thus have been unlikely to kill his brother over a fiscal matter.

**Political assassination**

In the wake of his 2015 film hitting cinemas, David says he was contacted by someone who had, in his opinion, the most credible theory as to Le Prince’s disappearance yet.

The caller explained that several other French people died in similarly mysterious or strange circumstances around the same time as Le Prince:

“He told me that he had the evidence to show that in the late 1880s and early 1890s, France was on the verge of another revolution...and the \[French\] government had set up a unit to look for subversives.”

Louis Le Prince, explains David, had previously been involved in a “semi-revolution” in Paris. What’s more, the fact that the inventor lived abroad - in Leeds - and was tinkering with inventions would have made him “automatically suspicious”, says David.

The conclusion of the caller was thus that Le Prince was assassinated by the government as a potential political enemy.

**Suicide or voluntary disembarkment**

Another theory as to Le Prince’s disappearance suggests that the inventor either voluntarily disembarked from the train before it reached Paris, or that he took his own life.

It’s known that Le Prince was in debt at the time, and some believe that may have motivated him to willingly disappear or kill himself.

Others, however, point out that the fact Le Prince had booked a screening in New York to reveal his breakthrough to the public makes this theory implausible.

**Random accident**

Laurie Snyder - Le Prince’s great-great granddaughter - told the BBC in 2015 that her theory on Le Prince’s disappearance is far more “mundane” than suicide or assassination.

She believes that Le Prince simply arrived in the wrong place at the wrong time, pointing to memoirs of Elizabeth Le Prince that suggest Le Prince would have arrived in Paris around 11pm.

“Being so late”, she told the BBC, “he probably hailed a hansom cab \[a horse-drawn carriage\] to take him to his workshop.

“I think the driver, taking advantage of the hour and the darkness, took him to a remote location near the Seine, hit him over the head and threw him in the Seine. There were two articles from this time that suggest that thieves were targeting lone travellers and Le Prince was in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

“I simply can't believe that a man who loved his family as much as he did, as evidenced by his letters, would either commit suicide or disappear on his own,” she added.",26,888,0.98,Disappearance,False,Unresolved Mysteries,No-Cow-445,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/it684a/130_years_ago_almost_to_the_day_louis_le_prince/

5minutes of exercise is a win!,1600154258.0,"""5minutes? That's nothing and it won't help! You need to exercise at least 30minutes for it to be effective"" is a sentence that makes my blood boil. Because everytime i tried to be active in the past 5minutes was all i could manage and there was always someone telling me a variation of that sentence after. In the past it made me feel like shit and like a failure so i stopped trying. But not this time!
I did zumba for the first time (home dvds) and again 5/6minutes was all i could manage (whole body sweatting,muscles giving up) and again someone (this time my boyfriend) told me ""that doesn't do anything"" and i got angry. 
I was proud of my 5minutes, because i did SOMETHING. When you are out of breath by just walking stairs or walking in general for a while and haven't truely exercised since school, 5minutes is a win! Sure 5minutes won't make me lose lots of weight and make me super fit BUT 5minutes were a start, a much needed start! 5minutes turned to 7 to 9 to 12 to 20. 
I didn't even have to get to 20 before i noticed a difference in my day to day life. Stairs weren't a problem anymore, walking fast didn't hurt my feet, standing up from the couch was easy and my overall body feeling changed. And it was all thanks to the original 5minutes.

So please if you struggle like i did: just do what you are able to. Doesn't matter if its only 1minute. 
Try out different things (my favorite 3 so far: zumba, ring fit adventure and chloe ting workouts on youtube)
You don't even have to do it every day. Improvement will happen over time. And any kind of improvement is better than getting worse or staying the same.
I'm currently working on finishing a 30min workout video in one go. So far i can only manage 50% with 1 break but that's ok. Every try will make it easier.

"IF YOU HAVE AN URGE, READ THIS NOW",1600155322.0," 

I'm gonna give it to you straight - do you really want to fuck up your life? I don't care if you're starting over or if you have a long streak going, you KNOW that feeling of relapse. You know that feeling of shame, darkness, and regret. Just take a second to think, what if you didn't do it? Think about the difference between you relapsing right now and you doing something else. Remember that if you jerk off, you're only looking at pixels on a screen. You're not even the one having the sex. Think about that. All you're doing is watching someone else getting fucked while you jerk off to it. Those people in the video don't even know you exist. Yet you're so interested in watching them do all kind of things that you were once disgusted by, but now you find it enjoyable.

Get the thought of jerking off or anything sexual out of your head. You know the negatives of porn. Look up, ""your brain on porn"" and look at images on google. Imagine how you're brain looks right now. Do you want to keep fucking up your brain? It's only going to come back at you, and your mental health will continue to suffer. Think about your sex life. If you ever get in a relationship or already in one, imagine how much sex won't satisfy you. It will only leave you wanting more, which will make you ignore your partner, and you won't give them much attention or love as they deserve. And for us guys out here, you already know about ED, and if you haven't already gotten it, it's coming your way. Stop saying ""I've been only doing it for this many months or this many years,"" because 2 months turn into 2 years and 2 years turn into 4 years, and it doesn't stop there. How long are you going to keep doing this? Don't you want to be happy, don't you want to be free? I just want to say that making an effort to stop porn means that you respect yourself. Joining NoFap, getting help, and even reading this long post shows an effort. I don't want to make you feel bad, that's far from what this is. But you have to understand that you are way too beautiful of a person to keep doing this. And if anyone else doesn't think so, I think so and so does this entire community.

If you have any social media, delete it or use it less. There's too many sex-related things on there, and you know what I mean. Why don't you do something more valuable? Cook for yourself, catch up on some reading, meditate, talk with some friends, clean up your space, or anything else. Cold showers are a good way to keep your mind in the right place, and no matter how embarrassing it is, talk with a trusted friend and let them know how you're feeling.

You wanna watch porn? Go ahead. Find a space on your own, grab your lotion, go on incognito, and search up your favorite porn website or porn-star. And after you get done tell me how you feel. Do you still feel happy? Do you feel like doing anything else productive for the rest of your day? Think about your body, relationships, and mental health. Think about all the effects it has on you. This is your last chance. If you truly wish to recover and if you honestly love yourself, then I know you'll make the right decision. **I'll leave it at that.**",132,1652,0.97,Slip-Up Prevention - Urgent!,False,Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum,NoLoveNoLifebruh,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/it45p4/if_you_have_an_urge_read_this_now/

Em fails my homeschooling work because “it’s not how she wants it”,1600142582.0,"It may sound stupid, but yes, my mom is failing me because my handwriting isn’t correct and I snapped back at her today. A general rundown, I prefer using print handwriting instead of cursive. Cursive to me is just a bunch of loops and it’s annoying to use. My mom obsesses over everything and thinks using cursive will get me a college education because “people who use cursive are smarter”.

This morning I finished an ELA packet and gave it to my mom to look through. Instantly she takes out this big red marker and writes F over the top of the first page. This is the conversations that ensued:

EM: I can’t believe you did it again.

Me: What?

EM: YOU DIDNT USE CURSIVE!

Me: I’m failing this because I’m not using cursive?

EM: exactly! You need to use cursive or else you won’t succeed in life!

Me: But-

EM: HOW DARE YOU TRY TO TALK BACK TO ME! GO TO YOUR ROOM!

I walk upstairs and play on my phone for a bit. After about ten minutes, my dad walks in and he explains my mom is failing my entire ela work for the past month because I’m not using cursive. This will go onto a record that will be passed to my high school and then the college I will eventually go to.  My dad agrees that it’s complete BS but he can’t change it because she’s the one who got the homeschooling license. She then later told me I’m going to “live under a bridge and work on the streets” because I don’t use cursive. I’m pissed and I want to know if I’m being dramatic or if my mom’s just being a jerk.

Em fails my homeschooling work because “it’s not how she wants it”,1600142582.0,"It may sound stupid, but yes, my mom is failing me because my handwriting isn’t correct and I snapped back at her today. A general rundown, I prefer using print handwriting instead of cursive. Cursive to me is just a bunch of loops and it’s annoying to use. My mom obsesses over everything and thinks using cursive will get me a college education because “people who use cursive are smarter”.

This morning I finished an ELA packet and gave it to my mom to look through. Instantly she takes out this big red marker and writes F over the top of the first page. This is the conversations that ensued:

EM: I can’t believe you did it again.

Me: What?

EM: YOU DIDNT USE CURSIVE!

Me: I’m failing this because I’m not using cursive?

EM: exactly! You need to use cursive or else you won’t succeed in life!

Me: But-

EM: HOW DARE YOU TRY TO TALK BACK TO ME! GO TO YOUR ROOM!

I walk upstairs and play on my phone for a bit. After about ten minutes, my dad walks in and he explains my mom is failing my entire ela work for the past month because I’m not using cursive. This will go onto a record that will be passed to my high school and then the college I will eventually go to.  My dad agrees that it’s complete BS but he can’t change it because she’s the one who got the homeschooling license. She then later told me I’m going to “live under a bridge and work on the streets” because I don’t use cursive. I’m pissed and I want to know if I’m being dramatic or if my mom’s just being a jerk.

Somebody read too much IDontWorkHereLady stories.,1600140521.0,"I am quite short - just under 5ft - and most of the time I an quite comfortable with my height. But supermarkets are my bane. All too often I find things that I need up on top shelf. Right where I maybe can tease them down with my fingertips standing on my toes, if I am lucky. So usually I prefer not to risk tipping whole shelf over and just ask closest fellow shopper if they will get whatever I need. Never ever had any problems, those who are busy will just ignore me, those who have a moment will help.

But yesterday I run into a man who just had to turn it into a huge confrontation. I was looking at a pepper jar thinking if I can get it down myself or better look for help. He came up right at my side and took a similar jar, so before he moved away I asked if he could get a second jar for me, please. He immediately exploded that I am too dumb and can't see that he doesn't work here, he is just shopping like I do. His rant lasted a couple of minutes, insulting me and generally swearing. I was so glad that I finally grew thicker skin, he nearly drove me to tears before I got angry. Thankfully another shopper came past us and I turned to her, ignoring still ranting man and asked her if she would get pepper for me. She did and I thanked her, turning to leave.

Is it normal to not follow your favourite musicians/actors on social media because you don't want to ruin the good image you have of them in your mind?,1600141772.0,"I know this is something trivial and kind of stupid, but as the title says I really avoid following popular artists on social media because it destroys the good image I have of them in my mind. 

I ofcourse know that an artist's work, no matter how inspiring it is, doesn't really reflect upon who they are in real life in most cases, but the amount of selling out, drama, faking and narcissism that a lot of these people partake in while their work advocates for the exact opposite is just a bit too much for me. 

It also makes me cringe to see their fans literally worshipping them in the comments section of their posts/tweets when the artist in concern doesn't even care or read what they write.

Stop pressuring me into drinking booze because YOU are unable to have fun without it!,1600169655.0,"I just don't get it, why are people unable to just accept it when I refuse to drink an alcoholic beverage? It's not that I'm against it, on the contrary. I love tasting good wines, trying new beers and  fancy cocktails.

But I know myself. I'm a lightweight, alcohol makes me sleepy really fast. So no more than 2-3 drinks for me. And none at all if I'm the driver, because even the first drink makes me unfit for totally safe driving. 

You'd think that those are completely valid reasons not to drink, but apparently NOT. Each time I go out with friends or family it's the same circus, as soon as I state that I'm not drinking anymore everyone gangs up against me, here are my favorites:

""You need a drink to relax, you're no fun right now!"" *Maybe I'd be funnier and more relaxed if all of you weren't harassing me about my drink*

""Oh come on have one more drink, it won't make a difference!"" *The breathalyser will probably say oitherwise*

""Yeah it's not strong"" *(It's just pure rhum, but if you say so)*

""nah you're exagerating, one drink only can't make you sleepy!"" *Oh thank you uncle Barry for explaining to ME how MY body works!!!*

""it's very unlikely that there will be cops on your road, here drink up!"" *...That's not the point, I don't want to kill myself or someone else*

""you're worrying to much, here's your glass!"" *and they forcefully pour a glass I won't drink, thus making me an ingrateful bitch*

""When I was your age I drank ten times more and never had an accident, you have to toughten up!""

*Sure GrandPa, nevermind that two of your cousins were killed on the road by an inebriated driver*

&#x200B;

Pro Tip: Use More Kids,1600181902.0,"Children are the ultimate Swiss Army knife of enabling role play situations. 
Need to make your players feel bad ass? Have some children vocally fawn over how cool they look. 
Need to give your NPCs depth, or make villains sympathetic? Give them children they care about. 
Want to introduce the idea that a certain race a player is playing is unusual? Have a kid ask them an innocent question, like if a Water Genasi eats anything other than water. 
Just having children around is a chance for players to show off their characters.  Think of a scene from the first Guardians of the Galaxy, when a group of poor children move past the heroes. Quill says “Watch your pockets”, Gamora smiles at them, while Groot cements his role as a kind soul by stopping to give a little girl a flower. 
It will be well established throughout the game how your player characters deal with villainy. Give them a chance to show how they deal with innocence as well.",26,383,0.99,Guide / How-to,False,DMAcademy,Kepsli,https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/itaeq7/pro_tip_use_more_kids/
Spacewave - A whole new universe of music to explore,1600177131.0,"Hey,

over the last two years Spacewave became more and more one of my favorite music genres.

I always loved the synth soundtracks of the 80s (Blade Runner, Terminator,...)

And this genre puts a modern touch and production to it,  combines spacey and sci-fi elements with cinematic and symphonic parts.

&#x200B;

If you need a kick start, these are some of my saved playlists:

Synthwave from Space (Maybe the biggest and most popular one):

"How I teach men not to talk over me: from one queen to another, when basic respect is lagging and conversations are impossible",1600165372.0,"I’ve done this to several men, and they catch on rather quickly. You’ll be able to have a conversation right then and there, and it works long term too - they might’ve forgot their manners by the time you talk to them again, but by repeating this, they’ll eventually learn to let you talk without you having to do this at the start of every convo. Source: I have a very stubborn male relative, who eventually learned too.

1. When they interrupt you, stop talking. Don’t try to raise your voice or battle them. Be completely quiet and wait.
2. Ignore **everything** they’re saying. Do not actually listen - just wait until they shut up. Don’t make a point of anything they say, do not answer to anything they say, do not refer to anything they say here. Literally do not listen a single word. Let them rant as long as they want.
3. When they finally shut up and wait for your reaction, say: ”I wasn’t done talking.”
4. Start over whatever you were saying when they interrupted you. I don’t care if it was a 10-minute explanation of rocket science. **Start. Over.** Repeat you original thought, but do not add anything related to what they just said while talking over you. That gives them the idea that it’s okay to interrupt you, you’ll still listen and pay attention and they’ll get their point clear without having to listen to yours. (It’s especially funny when you get done and they expect you to keep going talking about whatever they talked over you. The face when it sinks in that you didn’t listen a single word is glorious.)
5. If they interrupt you again, return to step 1. If you find yourself repeating the cycle over 3 times, tell them: ”you’re not letting me speak. Either you listen and wait for your turn, or our conversation ends here.” If they try to make excuses, laugh it off or keep interrupting, end the conversation. Prove them that **if they wont let you speak, they’re not worth your time.**

Why does this work? First, because sometimes talking over is internalized and men don’t actually notice they’re doing it. Being vocally called out makes them realize it and pay attention to it - especially if it happens more than once. Secondly, by refusing to aknowledge anything they say when they interrupt you, they’ll soon realize they will not get their own point across if they keep doing that. Peoole and especially men have the need to be heard and paid attention to when they talk - when you make it clear that by talking over you, they will not have your attention, they’ll learn to wait until you’re done, because they know that’s when you will be paying attention and actually listening.

Go my darlings. Have some actual conversations where your point of view is just as valid as his. Demand the basic respect of being heard. You can actually have some interesting conversations with men when they’re forced to listen too, when being louder is not going to make them feel like they’re dominating the conversation or winning the argument.",74,792,0.89,STRATEGY,False,Female Dating Strategy ,Descendant_of_Innana,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/it627d/how_i_teach_men_not_to_talk_over_me_from_one/

AskScience AMA Series: I'm a disaster researcher and scientist for fiction with irrepressible curiosity about our wonderfully weird universe. AMA!,1600167607.0,"Academically, I'm a physicist and geophysicist specializing in disasters-tsunami, earthquakes, asteroid impacts-pretty much all the heart-pounding, doom-riddled science. Practically speaking, I give tasting notes on rocks, tweak party planning to enhance disaster preparedness, and spend way too much time talking about doom. My work involves everything from figuring out landslides on asteroids for Project ESPRESSO to scrawling equations and establishing plausibility for fiction like Stargate and Star Trek. I'm also a science writer, with bylines in Wired, io9, Popular Science, Vox, and more. I share my press passes (and social media) with a bevy of mischievous plush creatures.

[Advice] The effort you exert when no one is watching is in direct correlation to the results you will breed when everyone is watching.,1600161321.0,"(The comments were before this description, I wrote this in the comments but decided it should also be the description instead of just the title quote)

Every single thing you do, all the hard work, the sweat, the blood, the tears, all of the energy and effort you put into your craft and your goals behind closed doors, matter. 

Every single second matters. 

Every single decision matters. 

Everything matters. 

One day, the sum of all your decisions in life will determine why you stand where you stand, how you got to where you are. 

The result will either be the exact same position, mindset and body that you were in a year ago, or it will be where you said all of that would be, in a year's time.
